                    <h2 class="section-header"> WHY DID WE START THIS?</h2>
                <p>
                    The main reason to why we started this was, we came from a middle class family where we were surrounded by families who had issues financially, and found that, sending a boy to a college or a school was better than sending a girl to one.Hence the start of this scholarship program.Therefore we aim to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Empower: Education is a powerful tool for empowerment. A girls' scholarship can empower young women by providing them with the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to make informed decisions about their lives, pursue their aspirations, and become leaders in their communities.</li>






<li>Global Development Goals: Scholarships for girls align with international development goals, such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Goal 4 focuses on quality education, and goal 5 emphasizes gender equality and empowerment of women and girls.</li>

<li>Diversity and Inclusion: A diverse and inclusive society benefits from the talents, perspectives, and contributions of all its members. A girls' scholarship program contributes to creating a more inclusive educational environment and workforce.</li>

<li>Long-Term Societal Benefits: The benefits of educating girls extend to future generations. Educated mothers are more likely to prioritize education for their own children, creating a positive cycle of educational attainment and progress.</li>
